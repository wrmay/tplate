# Overview

The purpose of tplate is to allow the creation of template based projects.  Jinja2 is used as the templating 
language.  The tplate tool takes two parameters.  The first parameter is a template directory and the second 
is the output directory.  All of the files in the template directory are copied to the output directory.  Files 
ending in ".tplate" are treated as Jinja2 templates and rendered into the output directory. For ".tplate" files, 
the file name in the output directory will be the template file name minus the ".tplate" suffix.  For example, 
README.md.tplate would be copied to README.md in the output directory.

There are a couple of exceptions to this.  If a .git folder exists it will not be copied. Neither will any file 
named "tplate.json", "tplate.yaml" or "tplate_finalize.py".

The template directory must contain a file named tplate.json or tplate.yaml, which contains all of the variables
that are referenced in the template. The  purpose of this file is to document the variables that are in the
templates and to provide default values. This file must be copied into the output directory and modified as desired.

The output directory must exist and contain a tplate.json file (or tplate.yaml) and nothing else.  

There are some cases when it is desirable for the output directory structure to be determined by a variable.  Most 
notably, java package names.  Currently the way to deal with this is with a post processing script.  The script 
must be placed in the template directory, it must be named "tplate_finalize.py" and it must contain a function named 
"run" which takes a single argument.  The  argument will be a context which was loaded from the "tplate.json" or 
"tplate.yaml" file. To access a variable called "java_package" that was provided in "template.json" , the run method 
would use `context['java_package']`.  Additionally,  `context['output_dir']` will be set to the path of the output 
directory and `context['template_dir']` will contain the path to the template directory.

The code sample below is the complete contents of a "tplate_finalize.py" script that renames the package 
"com.mytemplate.demo" to the package name specified in the "java_package" variable.

```python
# sample tplate_finalize.py file

import os
import os.path
import shutil


def run(context):
	from_dir = os.path.join(context['output_dir'],'src','main','java','com','mytemplate','demo')
	to_dir = os.path.join( context['output_dir'],'src','main','java', *context['java_package'].split('.'))
	shutil.copytree(from_dir, to_dir)
	shutil.rmtree(from_dir)
	remove_empty_dirs(os.path.join(context['output_dir'],'src','main','java'))

def remove_empty_dirs(adir):
	file_list = os.listdir(adir)
	if len(file_list) == 0:
		shutil.rmtree(adir)
	else:
		for f in file_list:
			subdir = os.path.join(adir,f)
			if os.path.isdir(subdir):
				remove_empty_dirs(subdir)

```
